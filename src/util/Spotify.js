/* Notes re Spotify API:
The base address of Web API is https://api.spotify.com. The API provides a set of endpoints, each with its own unique path. To access private data through the Web API, such as user profiles and playlists, an application must get the userâ€™s permission to access the data. Authorization is via the Spotify Accounts service.
URI (resource identifier) format: spotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6 
Implicit Grant Flow (relevant option for connecting to Spotify API): use for apps using JavaScript and running in browser - no server-side code needed. See https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#implicit-grant-flow */
